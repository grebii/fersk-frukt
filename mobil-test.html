                    <br><br>
                    <hr>
                    <br>
                    "Harry, you look different," said Hermione as I joined her and Ron in a compartment on the Hogwarts
                    Express.
                    <br><br>
                    I suppose I did. I was wearing an ushanka with a Red Star, a Che Guevara T-shirt, and browline
                    glasses.
                    I
                    had grown a
                    scruffy beard and had had my scar changed from a lightning bolt to a hammer and sickle.
                    <br><br>
                    "Why are you wearing a shirt with that murderer on it?" asked Hermione as I sat down.
                    <br><br>
                    "He's not a murderer, he's a soldier," I explained. "I'd be offended, but I know you've been
                    brainwashed
                    by
                    the
                    bourgeoisie capitalist establishment. You're suffering from false consciousness."
                    <br><br>
                    "What's false consciousness?" asked Ron curiously. I knew he would be more open to communist ideas
                    because
                    he was part
                    of the proletariat, whereas Hermione was part of the bourgeois intelligentsia.
                    <br><br>
                    "False consciousness is when people think communism is bad," I explained. "Since communism is good,
                    it
                    means
                    they're
                    obviously insane."
                    <br><br>
                    "Harry, are you a communist?" asked Hermione in a quiet voice. I could tell she was scared, probably
                    of
                    losing her
                    private property.
                    <br><br>
                    "As a matter of fact, I am!" I said, knowing I had nothing to be ashamed of. "Uncle Vernon was
                    complaining
                    about
                    communists one day and I decided that anyone hated by Uncle Vernon couldn't be that bad. So I read
                    The
                    Communist
                    Manifesto and discovered how the world really worked."
                    <br><br>
                    "But — but," said Hermione, at a loss for words, "President Reagan said the Soviet Union was the
                    evil
                    empire. He
                    wouldn't have said that if it weren't true!"
                    <br><br>
                    I signed, wondering if Hermione was too deep in false consciousness to ever come around to the
                    correct
                    way
                    of thinking.
